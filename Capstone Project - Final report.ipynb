    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, Vegetarianism has become the most in-vogue dietary trend around the world. More and more people embrace the plan-based lifestyles. Even though the prospect of vegan dietary seems to be optimistic, the hyper-competitive essence in the catering market shouldn’t be neglected. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A restaurant operator from <b>Amsterdam</b> runs a very succesfull vegetarian restaurant in the neighborhood called the 'Oude Pijp'. However, since a couple of years, more and more similar restaurants are opening in the neighborhood. Therefore, he is looking for a location to open a second restaurant. He really likes Amsterdam, due to its high number of vegetarians, tourists and excellent accessibility. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator knows from previous experience that <b>location</b> makes as much, if not more, of a difference in the success of a new restaurant as the menu does. He tasked us to come up with a data-driven advice for the best location to open up a new restaurant. His main requirements are: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Similar neighborhood as current restaurant\n",
    "2. Low rent prices\n",
    "3. Not in suburbal area of Amsterdam\n",
    "4. Low number of competitors (vegetarian restaurants) yet.\n",
    "5. Safe environment\n",

    "#### Target audience\n",
    "This project is particularly useful for restaurant chain owners and/or investors looking to open and/or invest in a Vegetarian rest.\n",
    "The target audience of this report is the restaurant operator from Amsterdam. The restaurant is called <b> De Waaghals <b> and located just below the center of Amsterdam.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem description\n",
    "Ideally, the operator would open a restaurant in the heart of the city of Amsterdam. Although this would expose his restaurants to a lot of passing tourists each day, this would mean excessive costs in terms of rent each month. At this point, he doesn't want to take this risk. Therefore, he is looking for a similar neighborhood with lower average rent prices. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem to be resolved in this project is as follows: <br>\n",
    ">***Provide a top three of neighborhoods in Amsterdam that are ideal for opening a new restaurant, based on affordability, safety, demographics and competition***\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the rising demand for vegetarian dietary brings profit potential, there are lots of indices that need to be cautiously considered. So, how could we utilize machine learning to find the proper location to start the vegan business? One solution is using clustering method to group different districts by their restaurant category and leverage the result with population data. In the following paragraph, I will disclose the whole process of this solution."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "The following methodology is used to perform this research:\n",
    "1. **Data collection**. Usually, in these types of researches, centers of neighborhoods are used to evaluate statistics of neighborhoods. However, neighborhoods are not points but areas. Therefore, we will collect the polygons of the neighborhoods and add statistics from various sources.\n",
    "2. **Data preparation**. Combine all the data sources into a single format and extract important features from the larger datasets\n",
    "3. **Data visualization**. Plot the collected data on the maps of folium\n",
    "4. **Clustering**. Cluster similar neighborhoods into groups using k-means cluster algorithm\n",
    "5. **Results and recommendataions**"

    "3. **Rent costs** - We will estimate the rent costs per borough based on the average value per square meter of the venues. The data will be obtained via data.amsterdam.nl ([dataset: Gemiddelde WOZ-waarde woningen wijken en stadsdelen](https://data.amsterdam.nl/datasets/B4EcyyT9e_AFyQ/stedelijke-ontwikkeling-wijken/))\n",

    "In a fast-moving world, there are many real-life problems or scenarios where data can be used to find solutions to those problems. Like seen in the example above, data was used to cluster neighborhoods in Amsterdam in its 56 major neighborhoods. The results can help a restaurant operator to decide about the neighborhoods that fit the most his needs. <br>\n",

    "I have made use of some frequently used python libraries to scrape web-data, use Foursquare API to explore the major neighborhoods of Amsterdam and saw the results of segmentation of neighborhoods using a Folium map. <br>\n",

    "Similarly, data can also be used to solve other problems, which most people face in metropolitan cities. Potential for this kind of analysis in a real-life problem is discussed in great detail. Also, some of the drawbacks and chance for improvements to represent even more realistic pictures are mentioned."
